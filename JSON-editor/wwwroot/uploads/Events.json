This section also addresses opportunities and challenges of using existing household surveys for the purpose of migration as well as designing and implementing specialized migration surveys.\n\nKey questions for country presentations:\n\n- How have surveys been used in your country to international migration data?\n- Are data publically available?\n- What successes/challenges have been faced in using surveys?\n- What are the currently running surveys in the country? Frequency and sample size of those surveys?\n- Are basic migration questions included in those surveys? Any plans in attaching a migration module or add a few migration questions to any survey in the near future?\n- How can there be greater systematization in use of surveys?",
